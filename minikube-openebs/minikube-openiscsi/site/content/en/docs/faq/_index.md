## How to run an older Kubernetes version with minikube ?

You do not need to download an older minikube to run an older kubernetes version.
You can create a Kubenretes cluster with any version you desire using `--kubernetes-version` flag.

Example:

```bash
minikube start --kubernetes-version=v1.15.0
```


## Docker Driver: How to set the cgroup manager minikube uses?

By default minikube uses the `cgroupfs` cgroup manager for the Kubernetes clusters, if you are on a system with a systemd cgroup manager, this could cause conflicts.
To use `systemd` cgroup manager, run:

```bash
minikube start --force-systemd=true
```

## How to run minikube with Docker driver if existing cluster is VM?

If you have an existing cluster with a VM driver (virtualbox, hyperkit, KVM,...).

First please ensure your Docker service is running and then you need to either delete the existing cluster and create one
```bash
minikube delete
minikube start --driver=docker
```

Alternatively, if you want to keep your existing cluster you can create a second cluster with a different profile name. (example p1)

```bash
minikube start -p p1 --driver=docker 
```

## Does minikube support IPv6?

minikube currently doesn't support IPv6. However, it is on the [roadmap]({{< ref "/docs/contrib/roadmap.en.md" >}}).

## How can I prevent password prompts on Linux?

The easiest approach is to use the `docker` driver, as the backend service always runs as `root`.

`none` users may want to try `CHANGE_MINIKUBE_NONE_USER=true`,  where kubectl and such will still work: [see environment variables]({{< ref "/docs/handbook/config.md#environment-variables" >}})

Alternatively, configure `sudo` to never prompt for the commands issued by minikube.

## How to ignore system verification?

minikube's bootstrapper, [Kubeadm](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm) verifies a list of features on the host system before installing Kubernetes. in case you get this error, and you still want to try minikube anyways despite your system's limitation you can skip the verification by starting minikube with this extra option:

```shell
minikube start --extra-config kubeadm.ignore-preflight-errors=SystemVerification
```

## what is the resource allocation for Knative Setup using minikube?

Please allocate sufficient resources for Knative setup using minikube, especially when you run a minikube cluster on your local machine. We recommend allocating at least 6 CPUs and 8G memory.

```shell
minikube start --cpus 6 --memory 8000
```

## Do I need to install kubectl locally?

No, minikube comes with built-in kubectl [see minikube's kubectl documentation]({{< ref "docs/handbook/kubectl.md" >}}).
