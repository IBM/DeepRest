  How to add translations
---

All translations are stored in the top-level `translations` directory.

### Adding a New Language

* Add a new json file in the translations directory with the locale code of the language you want to add
  translations for, e.g. fr for French.

 ```
 ~/minikube$ touch translations/fr.json
 ~/minikube$ ls translations/
 de.json  es.json  fr.json  ja.json  ko.json  pl.json  zh-CN.json
 ```

* Run `make extract` from root directory to populate that file with the strings to translate in json
  form.

 ```
 ~/minikube$ make extract
 go run cmd/extract/extract.go
 Compiling translation strings...
 Writing to de.json
 Writing to es.json
 Writing to fr.json
 Writing to ja.json
 Writing to ko.json
 Writing to pl.json
 Writing to zh-CN.json
 Done!
 ```

* Add translated strings to the json file as the value of the map where the English phrase is the key.

 ```
 ~/minikube$ head translations/fr.json
 {
  "\"The '{{.minikube_addon}}' addon is disabled": "",
  "\"{{.machineName}}\" does not exist, nothing to stop": "",
  "\"{{.name}}\" profile does not exist, trying anyways.": "",
  "'none' driver does not support 'minikube docker-env' command": "",
  "'none' driver does not support 'minikube mount' command": "",
  "'none' driver does not support 'minikube podman-env' command": "",
  "'none' driver does not support 'minikube ssh' command": "",
  "'{{.driver}}' driver reported an issue: {{.error}}": "",
 ```

* Add the translations as the values of the map, keeping in mind that anything in double braces `{{}}` are variable names describing what gets injected and should not be translated.

 ```
 ~/minikube$ vi translations/fr.json
 {
         [...]
         "Amount of time to wait for a service in seconds": "",
         "Amount of time to wait for service in seconds": "",
         "Another hypervisor, such as VirtualBox, is conflicting with KVM. Please stop the other hypervisor, or use --driver to switch to it.": "",
         "Automatically selected the {{.driver}} driver": "Choix automatique du driver {{.driver}}",
         "Automatically selected the {{.driver}} driver. Other choices: {{.alternates}}": "Choix automatique du driver {{.driver}}. Autres choix: {{.alternatives}}",
         "Available Commands": "",
         "Basic Commands:": "",
         "Because you are using docker driver on Mac, the terminal needs to be open to run it.": "",
         [...]
 }
 ```

### Adding Translations To an Existing Language

* Run `make extract` to make sure all strings are up to date
* Edit the appropriate json file in the 'translations' directory, in the same way as described above.

### Testing translations

* Once you have all the translations you want, save the file and rebuild the minikube from scratch to pick up your new translations:

 ```
 ~/minikube$ make clean
 rm -rf ./out
 rm -f pkg/minikube/assets/assets.go
 rm -f pkg/minikube/translate/translations.go
 rm -rf ./vendor
 ~/minikube$ make
 ```
 Note: the clean is required to regenerate the embedded `translations.go` file

* You now have a fresh minikube binary in the `out` directory. If your system locale is that of the language you added translations for, a simple `out/minikube start` will work as a test, assuming you translated phrases from `minikube start`. You can use whatever command you'd like in that way.

* If you have a different system locale, you can override the printed language using the LC_ALL environment variable:

 ```
 ~/minikube$ LC_ALL=fr out/minikube start
 üòÑ  minikube v1.9.2 sur Darwin 10.14.5
